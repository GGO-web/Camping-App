Two separate mountain ranges are visible to the east and west. Ten campsites are spread out over the entirety of the two-mile loop trail, and are marked by brown wooden posts that emerge straight up from the ground. Fixed to these posts are small square signs with campsite numbers ranging from 1-10, arrows pointing in the direction of each site, and a small brown square showing two white silhouettes of gender-neutral hikers with walking sticks and backpacks. The sites themselves are located in the inner dune areas, which are the flat low points between dunes. The ground here is hard-packed, firmer, and often slightly darker than the soft white sand found in the dunes themselves. In some of the sites and along parts of the trail, you can find bushels of varying types of grasses, which tend to be around 1-2 feet tall and dark green and tan in color. There may also be other types of vegetation along the trail and in the campsites, including the soaptree yucca. Depending on the season, the yucca have two main components: their bayonet leaves, which are dark green, about an inch wide, and sharp enough at the tips to warrant their name; and the stem, which is a tall, woody feature that stands vertically from the base and is often over five feet tall. When a stem is present, many creamy white flowers rest on its tip. The flower petals harden after they bloom in late spring, and transform into firm capsules that house the yucca’s dark brown, round seeds. Each site is marked by a bright orange post that protrudes from the ground, with the site number on it.",
